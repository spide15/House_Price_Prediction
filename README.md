# House_Price_Prediction
🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a regression model to predict house prices using various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more. It involves:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding feature relationships and data distributions.

Model training: Implementing and comparing various regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).

Model evaluation: Using metrics like RMSE and R² score to assess model performance.

Model deployment (optional): Can be extended for deployment via Flask or Streamlit.

📂 Technologies used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
